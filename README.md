**This DLL has been tested to work on version 1.1.1279314.**

**Most commands do not work as they have been stripped out of the game or have been disabled.**

**Some commands that do work are:**
timescale
unbindall
bind
player_sustainammo
devmap
jump_height
bg_fallDamageMinHeight
bg_fallDamageMaxHeight
r_filmTweakInvert
r_filmTweakEnable
player_sprintUnlimited
player_sprintSpeedScale
cl_freelook


**How to use:**
Use a DLL injector to inject the dll into the game while its running, the rest should be obvious.

**TODO:**
1. Find a way to get the output of the console if there is any.
